                        <li>This notice applies to anyone who interacts with us in relation to our products and
                            services (“you”, “your”), via any channel (e.g. app, website, email, phone, walk-ins to
                            URS-branded accommodations, booking an URS-branded accommodation via a third
                            party travel agency, etc.). We may give you additional privacy notices if required for
                            specific interactions.

                            lodgings (i.e. you stay at a property that is not URS-branded), that partner will use your
                            personal data as shown in their privacy notice
                        </li>
                        <li>This privacy notice applies to individuals who enquire about, purchase or make use of
                            our products and services, such as when a user signs up with URS, modifies her account,
                            makes a booking (whether through our app, website, in person or via any other channel),
                            requests on-demand services, contacts customer support, stays at URS-branded
                            accommodations or otherwise communicates or interacts with URS.

                        <li>It describes how we handle your information, regardless of the way you contact us (e.g.
                            app, website, email, phone, walk-ins to URS-branded accommodations, etc.). Sometimes
                            we will provide you with additional information or notices, depending on the way we
                            interact with each other, e.g. if you use particular functionality on our app, we may
                            explain how that functionality uses your information.

                            accommodations without a responsible adult. This privacy notice is therefore not aimed
                            at children (below 15years of age). If you provide us with information about your
                            children (below 15years of age), it is processed as described in this notice.</li>

                        <li>Right to data portability: The right to ask for personal information you have made available to
                            us to be transferred to you or a third party in machine-readable formats.
                        </li>
                        <li>Right to withdraw consent: We do not normally rely on consent as a basis for processing your
                            personal information. We will only ask for your consent in very limited circumstances and, if we
                            do so, will make it obvious to you when we are asking for that consent and what that is for. You
                            have the right to withdraw any consent you have given us to handle your personal information. If
                            you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of use of your personal
                            information prior to the withdrawal of your consent.
                            These rights may not apply in all cases. If we do not comply with your request, we will explain
                            why. In response to a request, we will ask you to verify your identity if we need to, and to
                            provide information that helps us to understand your request better. If you would like more
                            information about your rights or to exercise any of your rights, please contact <a href="">dataprotection@URSrooms.com.</a>
